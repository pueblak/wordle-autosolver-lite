            A dict representing the decision tree used to find best guesses

            A dict mapping all valid guesses to their frequency of use

            The list of all possible answers
        guesses:
            The list of all valid guesses
        starters:
            A list of guesses the player wishes to begin with regardless of the
            game's response (may be empty) -- manual guesses may ignore these
        num_boards:
            The number of simultaneous games being played (each guess is made
            across all boards at once)
        hard:
            A boolean value representing whether the game mode is Hard
        master:
            A boolean value representing whether the game mode is Wordzy Master
        liar:
            A boolean value representing whether the game mode is Fibble
        endless:
            A boolean value representing whether the program is in endless mode
        auto_guess:
            A function which takes six arguments and returns a str; for an
            example of what is expected, refer to `manual_guess`
        auto_response:
            A function which takes eight arguments and returns a list; for an
            example of what is expected, refer to `manual_response`
        allow_print:
            A boolean value representing whether the program should print info
            to the console (each guess/response, progress bars, etc.) (default:
            False)

    Returns:
        A 2-tuple containing two lists of str: the first list contains the
        solutions for each board, in order; the second list contains every word
        guessed by the user (or the program), also in order.
